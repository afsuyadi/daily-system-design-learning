# 📚 System Design Study Roadmap

This repository contains my study notes, summaries, and diagrams while following the **System Design curriculum from roadmap.sh**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I’m using this repo to:

- Learn system design fundamentals end-to-end  
- Understand how scalable systems are built  
- Practice interview-style design problems  
- Document trade-offs and architectural decisions  

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered (Roadmap-Aligned)

This repository follows the structure of the roadmap.sh System Design curriculum.

## 🚀 Learning Workflow

For each topic:

1. Study the concept  
2. Summarize in my own words  
3. Draw architecture diagrams  
4. Analyze trade-offs  
5. Apply to a real-world design example

## 📖 Resources

- roadmap.sh System Design  
- Engineering blogs (Netflix, Uber, Amazon, etc.)  
- System design interview books  
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications  
- Real-world architecture case studies

## 📈 Goal

To develop strong system design intuition and be able to:

- Design scalable systems  
- Make informed trade-offs  
- Communicate architecture clearly  
- Perform confidently in system design interviews
